# FaceID Authentication System in SwiftUI

Welcome to the FaceID Authentication System in SwiftUI repository! This repository contains an iOS app built in SwiftUI that implements a secure FaceID authentication system. The app uses FaceID, TouchID, and fallbacks to a login with credentials if FaceID is not available or the device doesn't support biometric authentication.

## Features

- FaceID and TouchID Authentication: The app leverages the built-in biometric authentication capabilities of iOS devices to provide a secure and convenient login experience.
- Fallback Authentication: In cases where FaceID authentication is not supported or fails, the app gracefully falls back to a traditional login system that accepts credentials for authentication.
- SwiftUI Implementation: The app is developed using SwiftUI, Apple's modern declarative framework for building user interfaces, enabling a seamless and responsive user experience.
